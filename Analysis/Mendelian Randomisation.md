## Mendelian Randomization in R

- Mendelian Randomization was executed using [TwoSampleMR](https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/) in R
- the loneliness sumstats file (Day et al, 2018) was used as the exposure
- the internalising (F1) sumstats file (generated via multivariate GWA) was used as the outcome

### Installing Libraries

## Loneliness on F1
### Processing Outcome and Exposure Data
- this involves re-naming columns so that they can be read by MR
```r
#outcome data
outcome_F1 <- read_outcome_data(
  snps = NULL,                            #Keep 'snps=NULL' so that all SNPs are uploaded
  filename = "C:\\Users\\ellen\\OneDrive\\BSc Psych\\Publication Genetics\\MR and GWAS\\F1LONE", #This is the filename of the summary statistics file for your outcome
  sep = "\t",  #Specify whether the file is a tab delimited file ("\t") or a space delimited file ("")
  snp_col = "SNP",#Insert the name of column that includes the SNP ID's
  chr_col = "CHR",
  pos_col = "BP",
  beta_col = "BETA",  #Insert the name of column with effect sizes
  se_col = "SE",      #Insert the name of column with standard errors
  effect_allele_col = "A1", #Insert the name of column with the effect allele
  other_allele_col = "A2",  #Insert the name of column with the non-effect allele
  pval_col = "P", #Insert the name of column with p-value
  eaf_col="MAF",
  samplesize_col = "N")    #Insert the name of column with effect allele frequency
#Note: A few columns are not present in the sum stat file so cannot be read directly but can be added
outcome_internalising$outcome <- "F1" #Provide a name for the outcome

#Inspect your uploaded file:
length(outcome_F1$SNP) 

#Number of SNPs included  = 1968630


#exposure data

exposure_loneliness <- read_exposure_data(
  filename = "C:\\Users\\ellen\\OneDrive\\BSc Psych\\Publication Genetics\\MR and GWAS\\LONE", 
  sep = "\t",
  snp_col = "SNP",        
  beta_col = "BETA",         
  chr_col = "CHR",
  pos_col = "BP",
  se_col = "SE",       
  effect_allele_col = "A1",  
  other_allele_col = "A2", 
  pval_col = "P",  
  eaf_col="MAF",
  samplesize_col = "N") 

exposure_loneliness$exposure <- "loneliness"       
length(exposure_loneliness$SNP)

#Number of SNPs included = 7723212
```

### Quality Control, Harmonizing, then Clumping
- quality control involves selecting only significant genome-wide significant p-values for loneliness, harmonizing the data across GWAS' and clumping

```r
#Select genome-wide significant snps
exposure_loneliness5e8 <- subset(exposure_loneliness, pval.exposure < 5e-8)
# Lets have a look at the number of SNPs that we would include:
length(exposure_loneliness5e8$SNP) # Number of genome-wide significant snps: 15

#Harmonize
DataMR_lonelinesstoF1 <- harmonise_data(exposure_dat = exposure_loneliness5e8, outcome_dat = outcome_F1, action=2)
table(DataMR_lonelinesstoF1$mr_keep) # This columns tells you which SNPs will be kept for the main analysis: All rows that are set to TRUE will be included in the MR analysis. 

# N=420 => Number of SNPs kept for MR analysis after harmonisation
attr(DataMR_lonelinesstoF1, "log") # Detailed summary of what was done and reasons for excluding SNPs 



#Clump
exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped <- clump_data(DataMR_lonelinesstoF1, clump_r2 = 0.05, clump_p1 = 1, clump_p2 = 1, clump_kb = 250)
# Lets have a look at the number of SNPs we excluded
length(exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped$SNP) 

# N included = 18

```

## Mendelian Randomization
- Results can be found
```r
#running MR
(MR_lonelinesstoF1 <- mr(exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped))
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped), "markdown")
```

### Sensitivity Analyses
Cochran Q statistics
```r
Results_lonelinesstoF1_heterogeneity <- mr_heterogeneity(exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped)
Results_lonelinesstoF1_heterogeneity 
```
Pleiotropy test
```r
Results_lonelinesstoF1_pleiotropy <- mr_pleiotropy_test(exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped)
Results_lonelinesstoF1_pleiotropy #just non sig, suggesting that results are unlikely to be  driven by pleiotropy, IVW is fine, but so is Egger
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(Results_lonelinesstoF1_pleiotropy), "markdown")
```
Leave-one-out Egger analysis - good to see if results are biased by single SNPS
- MR Egger assumes no measurement error as measurement error can lead to underestimation of the true causal effect
- To check for this, the I2 can be measured, which is an indication of measurement error annd is derived from the Cochran Q statistics
- if IR > 90%, then we do not need to worry about measurement error or bias by single SNPS
```r
DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_leaveOut_egger<- mr_leaveoneout(exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped, method = mr_egger_regression) # Default: ivw method
DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_leaveOut_egger
# Check max and min of the beta and the pvalue to see if any snp has changed them dramatically
out2 <- apply(DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_leaveOut_egger[,c("b","p")], 2, function(x) {cbind(min(x), max(x))})
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(out2), "markdown") #doesnt seem that any SNP has had a dramatic effect

```

### MR Steiger
- this tests whether the directionality we have specified is correct
- it does this by comparing the independent correlations to see if they are statistically different and, if so, to what degree they statistically differ
- The test calculates the variance explained in the exposure and the outcome by the instrumenting SNPs, and tests if the variance in the outcome is less than the exposure

```r
#Run MR-Steiger
DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_Steiger <- directionality_test(DataMR_lonelinesstoF1)
DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_Steiger 

#says correct causal direction and highly sig (loneliness to F1)

# We can apply the test on one SNP
DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_Steiger <- directionality_test(exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped[1, ])
# As can be seen the r2 for the exposure is much bigger than for the outcome (although both of them are very small as this is just one SNP)
DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_Steiger$snp_r2.exposure/DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_Steiger$snp_r2.outcome # effect on the exposure 2.41


#Loop over all SNPs
SteigerSNPs= matrix(nrow = dim(exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped)[1], ncol = 8) 
for (i in 1:dim(exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped)[1]){
  temp  <- directionality_test(exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped[i, ])
  SteigerSNPs[i, ] = as.matrix(temp)
}

SteigerSNPs <- as.data.frame(SteigerSNPs)
names(SteigerSNPs) <- names(DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_Steiger)  
knitr::kable(head(SteigerSNPs), "markdown")
save(SteigerSNPs, file = "C:\\Users\\ellen\\OneDrive\\BSc Psych\\Publication Genetics\\MR and GWAS\\SteigerSNPs.RData")

table(SteigerSNPs$correct_causal_direction) # all SNPs in the right direction

exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped$correct_causal_direction <- SteigerSNPs$correct_causal_direction # integrate the correct_causal_direction column into DataMR
DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_Steigerfiltered <- exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped[exposure_loneliness5e8_clumped$correct_causal_direction == "TRUE",] #create DataMR only with those SNPs
dim(DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_Steigerfiltered) # rows match

# Redo MR with Steiger 
(MR_lonelinesstoF1_Steigerfiltered <- mr(DataMR_lonelinesstoF1_Steigerfiltered))

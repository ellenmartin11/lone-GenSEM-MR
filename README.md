# Genomic Structural Equation Modelling and Mendelian Randomization of Loneliness and Psychiatric/Substance Use Phenotypes

All scripts used for data analysis can be found in [Analysis](https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/tree/main/Analysis).

This project uses the [GenomicSEM package](https://github.com/GenomicSEM/GenomicSEM) and scripts from [Schoeler 2021](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2021_CommonLiabAddiction).

## Scripts include:
- [Quality Control and Data Preparation Procedures](https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/blob/main/Analysis/GenSEM%20QC.Rmd)
- Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (conducted via GenomicSEM) and Correlation Heatmap (https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/blob/main/GenSEM%20LDSC%20and%20Correlations.Rmd)
- Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Genomic Structural Equation Modelling (https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/blob/main/GenSEM%20Factor%20Analysis%20and%20GSEM.md)
- Multivariate GWAS (conducted via GenomicSEM using the UCL Myriad Cluster)

Figures include:
- Correlation Heatmap (https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/blob/main/MartinFigure1.pdf)

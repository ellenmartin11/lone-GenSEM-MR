## Data Preprocessing and Quality Control
- the script for this can be found [Here](https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/blob/main/Analysis/GenSEM%20QC.Rmd)
- it includes the general data clean-up and pre-processing as well as munging through GenomicSEM

## LD Score Regression
- the script for this can be found [Here](https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/blob/main/Analysis/GenSEM%20LDSC%20and%20Correlations.Rmd)
- it includes LDSC executed through GenomicSEM and the production of a correlation heatmap between all the phenotypes using the LDSC output 

## Construction of Latent Genomic Factors
- the script for this can be found [Here](https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/blob/main/Analysis/GenSEM%20Factor%20Analysis%20and%20GSEM.md)
- it contains the exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis 
- the GenomicSEM usermodels were then specified based on the best-fitting model according to [confirmatory factor analysis output](https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/blob/main/Results/CFA3.csv)
- the path diagrams were manually generated and can be found in [Fig 2](https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/blob/main/MartinFigure2.pdf) and [Fig 4](https://github.com/ellenmartin11/lone-GenSEM-MR/blob/main/MartinFigure4.pdf)

## Multivariate GWA
- for detailed analysis steps for multivariate GWA, see [Schoeler (2021)](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2021_CommonLiabAddiction/tree/master/analysis)
- a multivariate GWA was conducted only for F1 (internalising disorders) as this factor was the only one that remained significantly positively associated with loneliness in multivariate GenomicSEM

## Mendelian Randomization
- the script for this can be found Here.
- it includes Mendelian Randomisation conducted in R using the [TwoSampleMR](https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/) package
- it tests the SNP effects from loneliness (Day et al, 2018)  to internalising (output of multivariate GWA)
